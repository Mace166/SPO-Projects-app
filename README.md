# SPO-Projects-app
A User Interface (UI) design using Adobe XD for a Fabric UI/React Projects app based on SharePoint Online.

### Concept
To design a Sharepoint Online Projects SPFX application.

### Requirements
The app design will be created using Adobe UD and the Fabric UI toolkit.

The app must be intuitive and easy to use without training.

As the app would be inserted into a SharePoint Online Modern Experience site page zone, it must support a 100%, 50%, 33% and 67% column width.

The design must include the end-user functionality and how to edit the app from the side property pane.

The app should show the SharePoint online site theme colors fit into the existing styling of the page.

While the app itself will not be built as part of this project, the design must support an app created with React.

### Design Notes
The Projects app will include a project which includes stages and activities. These may need to be completed in sequence, so the design will need to clearly demonstrate the what is required at each stage and in which order stages/activities need to be completed.

The project can be assigned to people with different roles. Stages and activities can also be assigned to people.

Each project has a budget of time and cost. These can be either simple and assigned to the project stages or more granular and on to each activity. Progress bar indicators are to be used and simple graphs to show the time spent vs the time allocated.

Project resources are also included in the form of a document library being used with each project and stages having a created folder and sub-folders.

Users with the project administrator role have access to a projects administration overview and status view.

When designing a UI, I like to give control to the end-user over how they use the app. Therefore, I would like the end-user to be able to choose if they would like a simplified UI or a more detailed "power user" UI to suit their capabilities or preferences. This option would then be stored as a setting within the app and be persistent.

The end result would include an example of the design with a selection of different coloured themes.

The design will incorporate Sharepoint Online into its end-user functionality to demonstrate how it would look on a Modern Experience Team Site. This includes how it would function inside columns of different widths.

### Resources
[Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html) - Used for prototyping and sharing the interactive design.

[Adobe XD Fabric UI Toolkit](https://aka.ms/fabric-toolkit) - Used for including examples of Fabric UI to create a design that matches the existing SPO Modern Experience styling, which is also currently based on Fabric UI.

[Adobe XD SharePoint Toolkit](https://aka.ms/sharepoint-toolkit) - Used for the creation of the design including the SharePoint Online page structure and site page zones.

[SharePoint design principles](https://spdesign.azurewebsites.net/) - A page provided by Microsoft which explains the framework and provides links to additional resources.

### Design Evolution
The design is intended to evolve and be refined over time. If there are significant deviations in the design, I will create a new branch and provide the updated version while preserving the previous.
